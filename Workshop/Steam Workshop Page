[h1]Immersion Cigs - Rewrite[/h1]

[h2]Overview[/h2]

This mod adds an ability to smoke cigarettes or enjoy lollipops.
While smoking, the cig will change it's model to a smaller version disappearing in the end (around 5 minutes) and producing smoke while it's active.
Mod is fully multiplayer compatible so you will hear the sound of the matches from other players and you'll see the smoke coming from the cigarette synchronized between all clients.

We do not encourage anyone to smoke in real life, we don't smoke irl, it's just a small addition in favour for some additional immersion.

[!WARNING]
Due to the extensive rewrite, this is not compatible with Mods which have been based/are dependend on the original Mod.

[h2]What is included?[/h2]

[h3]Full Rewrite of pretty much everything.[/h3]
[list]
[*] no more scheduled code
[*] dependency on CBA
[*] Vanilla ScrollWheel Actions are replaced with CBA's Context Menu (Left Click on Inventory Screen)
[*] No more hard coded data, instead defined through config.
[*] Extensions, Compats or addition of new Types of Smokables/Suckables is much easier. Ether through integration in the main mod or by making an extension mod with this mod as a dependency.
[/list]

Every fix that came with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3146026772]Immersion Cig - Hotfix[/url]
[list]
[*] When taking a new Cigarette from the box, it will try to put the cig first in the goggles/face slot, ifn't, then the NVG slot and only as a last resort, it will put it in the inventory.
[*] Allows to light someone else's cig when its in the NVG slot.
[*] Rewrote all functions within the modified addon to avoid scheduled environment.(CBA Dependency).
[*] Matches, Lighter, Box of Cigarettes are now found in the Misc. Section of the ACE Arsenal
